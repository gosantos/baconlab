## Bacon IOT Lab

## Description

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have all of the following prerequisites installed in your machine:

* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

## Cloning the repostiroy

First of all you to clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gosantos/baconlab.git
```

## Installation

In this project we have one directory for the backend (server) and another one for the frontend (client). So for that reason you should install each one separately.

```bash
$ cd client 
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

```bash
$ cd client 
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Starting the application

In one terminal start the client with the following commands:

```bash
$ cd client 
$ gulp serve
```

In another one start the server:
```bash
$ cd server
$ npm start
```
